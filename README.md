# E-commerce-using-Wyam-And-SnipCart 
My JAMStack Project - This is an e-commerce website using Wyam static site generator ( for Dotnet framework ) and SnipCart (to integrate shopping cart functionalities )



JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is an architecture for building fast, secure, and scalable websites and applications.
The JAMstack approach involves pre-building website or application assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and serving them directly from a content delivery network (CDN).
This means that the website or application can be delivered quickly and securely to users without the need for a traditional server-side architecture.
